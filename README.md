# Overview
This is a project to help you create a Raspberry Pi cluster and demo DevOps practices from build/release to Chaos Engineering on it. According to a few friends, it's called a Raspberry Bush. Credit for the name goes to Antony Zimzores. Check out the companion blog article that goes into greater detail of thre build and process, [here](https://www.seanasaservice.com/blog/raspberry-bush). Altogether it cost around $850 and procided me with a lab with the following specs: 24 Cores @ 1.4GHz / 6GB RAM / 384GB Storage


# Build Materials
There are two ways you can build this, I chose to go the Power over Ethernet (PoE) route as the switch I chose provided me with and additional two 1GB uplink ports and gave me the ability to consolidate the need for power into a single connection to the Pi. When I did the cost analysis, the additional price of the PoE Hats + PoE Switch was only around $100 difference so it didn't make sense not to go with the cleaner look, less cables, one less power supply, and 2 additional network ports. Feel free to use whatever switch you like as long as it doesnt exceed the INTERIOR dimensions of the case your using. Luckily I pulled spec sheets on all switches considered and found a fair compromise of what I wanted and kept things tidy and simple. I did wish that had gone with 128GB cards but those cards get expensive when your buying 8, your wallets milage may vary.
